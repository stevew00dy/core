# Dashboard

The Dashboard serves as the central command center for the Multi-Agent AGI System, providing real-time visibility into system status, agent performance, and operational metrics. It's designed as the primary interface for monitoring and controlling the entire AGI ecosystem.

## Overview

The Dashboard is organized into three main sections:
- **system-overview/**: Real-time monitoring of agents, workload, and system health
- **quick-actions/**: One-click access to common operations and emergency controls
- **performance-metrics/**: Detailed analytics on system performance and efficiency

## Architecture

## Key Features

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Live Agent Status**: Track all active agents, their current tasks, and health status
- **Workload Distribution**: Visual representation of task distribution across agent pool
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and network utilization across the cluster
- **Activity Feed**: Real-time stream of system events and agent interactions

### Operational Control
- **Instant Code Generation**: Launch code generation tasks with predefined templates
- **Debate Orchestration**: Initiate multi-agent debates on complex problems
- **Review Management**: Access pending reviews and approval workflows
- **Emergency Controls**: Immediate system shutdown and safety controls

### Performance Analytics
- **Code Quality Metrics**: Track Pass@1, Pass@5, Pass@10 scores across different tasks
- **Response Time Analysis**: Monitor latency and throughput across agent interactions
- **Cost Optimization**: Real-time cost tracking with optimization recommendations
- **Success Rate Monitoring**: Track completion rates and quality metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **React Dashboard**: Modern, responsive interface built with React 18+
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live data streaming
- **Visualization**: Charts and graphs using D3.js and Chart.js
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with Tailwind CSS

### Backend Services
- **Dashboard API**: RESTful API for dashboard data aggregation
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time data streaming service
- **Metrics Collector**: Background service for performance data collection
- **Alert Manager**: Configurable alerting and notification system

### Data Sources
- **Agent Pool**: Live status from agent-management/ system
- **Memory System**: Context and knowledge graph data from memory-knowledge/
- **Workflow Engine**: Task execution and completion data from workflows-automation/
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes cluster metrics and logs

## MCP Integration

All dashboard operations use MCP tools for consistent communication:

```typescript
// Example MCP tool integration
const dashboardTools = [
  'get_system_overview',
  'get_agent_status',
  'trigger_code_generation',
  'start_agent_debate',
  'emergency_shutdown',
  'get_performance_metrics'
];
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
DASHBOARD_PORT=3000
WEBSOCKET_PORT=3001
METRICS_COLLECTION_INTERVAL=5000
ALERT_THRESHOLD_CPU=80
ALERT_THRESHOLD_MEMORY=85
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_UPDATES=true
```

### Dashboard Settings
```json
{
  "refreshInterval": 1000,
  "maxActivitiesDisplay": 100,
  "enableNotifications": true,
  "defaultView": "overview",
  "autoRefresh": true,
  "alertConfiguration": {
    "enabled": true,
    "channels": ["email", "slack", "webhook"]
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Quick Code Generation
```typescript
// Trigger code generation from dashboard
await mcpClient.call('trigger_code_generation', {
  type: 'function',
  requirements: 'Sort array of objects by multiple properties',
  language: 'typescript',
  priority: 'high'
});
```

### Emergency System Control
```typescript
// Emergency shutdown procedure
await mcpClient.call('emergency_shutdown', {
  reason: 'Resource exhaustion detected',
  graceful: true,
  timeout: 30000
});
```

### Performance Monitoring
```typescript
// Get real-time performance metrics
const metrics = await mcpClient.call('get_performance_metrics', {
  timeRange: '1h',
  includeBreakdown: true,
  aggregation: 'avg'
});
```

## Security Considerations

- **Role-based Access**: Different dashboard views based on user permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All dashboard actions are logged for security auditing
- **Emergency Access**: Secure emergency controls with multi-factor authentication
- **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data is masked based on user access levels

## Performance Optimization

- **Lazy Loading**: Components load on-demand to reduce initial load time
- **Data Caching**: Intelligent caching strategy for frequently accessed data
- **Websocket Optimization**: Efficient real-time data streaming with compression
- **Mobile Optimization**: Progressive web app capabilities for mobile access

- **agent-management/**: Provides agent status and pool information
- **memory-knowledge/**: Supplies contextual insights and historical data
- **analytics-reports/**: Feeds detailed performance analytics
- **security-safety/**: Integrates security alerts and safety controls
- **monitoring-observability/**: Provides infrastructure and application metrics

The Dashboard serves as the nerve center of the Multi-Agent AGI System, providing the visibility and control necessary for effective management of complex AI operations.
