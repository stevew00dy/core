# MCP GitHub Push Process Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the process used to push all Core folders and files to GitHub using the Docker MCP Toolkit gateway, bypassing traditional git authentication issues.

## Prerequisites
1. **MCP Gateway Running**: Docker MCP gateway must be running with GitHub tools
   ```bash
   docker mcp gateway run
   ```

2. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Configured in MCP secrets for authentication
   - Token should have repository permissions
   - Stored securely in MCP configuration

## Process Steps

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Check local directory structure with `ls -la`
- Verify git repository status with `git status`
- Check existing remote configuration with `git remote -v`
- Fetch remote references with `git fetch origin`

### 2. Identify Available MCP Tools
```bash
docker mcp tools list
```
Key tools used:
- `create_or_update_file`: Create or update individual files
- `get_file_contents`: Check existing repository contents
- `list_branches`: Verify repository structure

### 3. Repository Content Analysis
```bash
docker mcp tools call get_file_contents owner=stevew00dy repo=core path="/"
```
This reveals what's already in the GitHub repository vs. local files.

### 4. File Upload Strategy
Since traditional `git push` failed due to authentication issues, we used the MCP GitHub API tools to upload files individually:

#### For Existing Key Files:
```bash
docker mcp tools call create_or_update_file owner=stevew00dy repo=core branch=main path="documentation/research-paper.md" message="Add documentation folder with research paper" content="$(cat documentation/research-paper.md)"
```

#### For Creating Directory Structure:
Create placeholder README files in each major directory:
```bash
docker mcp tools call create_or_update_file owner=stevew00dy repo=core branch=main path="administration/README.md" message="Add administration module structure" content="# Administration Module..."
```

### 5. Systematic Upload Process
Uploaded files/folders in this order:
1. **documentation/** - research-paper.md, final-overview.md
2. **memory-core/** - README.md
3. **ide-interface/** - package.json
4. **administration/** - README.md (placeholder)
5. **analytics-reports/** - README.md (placeholder)
6. **configuration/** - README.md (placeholder)
7. **human-review/** - README.md (placeholder)
8. **monitoring-observability/** - README.md (placeholder)
9. **security-safety/** - README.md (placeholder)
10. **workflows-automation/** - README.md (placeholder)

### 6. Verification
Final verification with:
```bash
docker mcp tools call get_file_contents owner=stevew00dy repo=core path="/"
```

## Key Commands Used

### List MCP Tools
```bash
docker mcp tools list
```

### Upload Single File
```bash
docker mcp tools call create_or_update_file owner=USERNAME repo=REPO branch=main path="FILEPATH" message="COMMIT_MESSAGE" content="$(cat LOCALFILE)"
```

### Check Repository Contents
```bash
docker mcp tools call get_file_contents owner=USERNAME repo=REPO path="/"
```

### Get File Contents from GitHub
```bash
docker mcp tools call get_file_contents owner=USERNAME repo=REPO path="FILEPATH"
```

## Advantages of MCP Approach

1. **Authentication**: Bypasses local git credential issues
2. **Granular Control**: Upload specific files without full repository sync
3. **API Integration**: Direct GitHub API access through MCP tools
4. **Selective Upload**: Can choose exactly which files to upload
5. **Immediate Feedback**: Get commit SHAs and URLs for each upload

## Limitations

1. **File Size**: Large files may hit GitHub API limits
2. **Binary Files**: Text files work best, binary files may need special handling
3. **Batch Operations**: No native bulk upload, requires individual file uploads
4. **History**: Creates individual commits per file rather than single batch commit

## Future Improvements

1. **Bulk Upload Script**: Create script to batch multiple file uploads
2. **Directory Sync**: Implement recursive directory synchronization
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Add logic to handle file conflicts
4. **Progress Tracking**: Better progress indication for large uploads

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Missing SHA Error**: File exists on GitHub but SHA not provided
   - Solution: Get current file SHA with `get_file_contents` first

2. **Authentication Failed**: MCP gateway not properly configured
   - Solution: Verify GitHub token in MCP secrets

3. **Invalid Branch**: Branch doesn't exist
   - Solution: Use `list_branches` to verify available branches

### Error Examples
```
error calling tool create_or_update_file: missing required parameter: branch
```
- Always include `branch=main` parameter

```
"sha" wasn't supplied. []
```
- File exists on GitHub, need to provide current SHA for updates
